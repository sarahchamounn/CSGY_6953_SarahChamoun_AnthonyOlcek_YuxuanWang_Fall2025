Deep Learning Midterm

This repository contains our deep learning project work, including various attempts, saved model checkpoints, and the final implementation that achieved an accuracy score of 0.77888.

## Project Structure

### a) Saved data (old)
This folder contains saved model data, checkpoints, training artifacts, and optimizer states from previous training runs. These files include adapter configurations, tokenizer settings, training state information, and model weights. **Note: We aren't sure if this is the most recent version, but it was from a successful attempt.**

A backup of this data is also available on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Rmi3H5qYaNoGgRh68PwHe2-VrdayvDW?usp=sharing

### b) Old Attempts
This folder contains some of our attempts. These notebooks document various iterations and experimental approaches we tried during the development process, including different model architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies.

### c) FINAL ATTEMPT
This folder contains the final version of our project, which achieved an **accuracy score of 0.77888**. This represents our best performing model and includes:

- `7) AFO_Attempt_5.ipynb` - Final notebook with the complete implementation
- `7) AFO_Attempt_5.py` - Python script version of the final notebook
- `Version 7 (Final) Progress pictures.pdf` - Progress documentation showing the development process
